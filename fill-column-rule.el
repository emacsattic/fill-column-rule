;;; Commentary:

;; Many modern editors and IDEs indicate the location of the fill column with
;; a thin line (in design parlance, a `rule') running the length of the
;; editing window.  Fill-column-rule implements this facility in Emacs.

;; Installation
;; ============

;; Put this file somewhere in your load path and put
;;
;;   (require 'fill-column-rule)
;;
;; in your .emacs.  To toggle display of the fill-column rule in a buffer,
;; use the command `fcr-mode'.

;; Under v23 and later, it is recommended that you set line-move-visual to
;; nil when using fcr-mode.  To ensure that that happens add the following to
;; your .emacs:
;;
;;   (setq fcr-handle-line-move-visual t)
;;
;; Then line-move-visual will be automatically set to nil when fcr-mode is
;; enabled and restored to its previous value when fcr-mode is disabled.

;; Customization
;; =============

;; See the documentation of the variables `fcr-handle-line-move-visual',
;; `fcr-rule-character', `fcr-color', and `fcr-fallback-character', or use the
;; Customization menu (under Convenience).

;; Troubleshooting
;; ===============

;; o If the fill-column rule is misaligned on some lines but otherwise
;;   looks normal, then you're most likely not displaying the buffer
;;   contents with a monospaced font.  Note that certain font-lock
;;   themes set some faces so that they look monospaced but aren't quite
;;   so.  You can tell if that's the source of the problem by turning
;;   off font-lock and resetting fcr-mode.

;; o If the fill-column rule is a dashed (rather than uninterrupted) line
;;   and the buffer is unibyte, then that is the intended behavior.  If the
;;   buffer is multibyte, the issue is one of font selection; see the next
;;   section.

;; o If activating fcr-mode increases the line spacing in the window, then
;;   you need to change the font options for fcr-mode. See the next section.

;; o If the fill-column rule looks too thick (say, has the width of a normal
;;   column) or is a series of boxes, then the problem is most likely one of
;;   font selection.  Again, see the next section.

;; Font Selection
;; ==== =========

;; The following remarks are pitched at an introductory level, for
;; inexperienced users; apologies if others find that tedious.

;; Fill-column-rule draws the rule using non-ascii whitespace characters; it
;; depends on Emacs to find a font that can display them and that has the
;; same character height as the default font in use.  Several of the problems
;; described in the previous section arise when it can't do so.

;; The solution is explicitly to request a particular font family.  To see
;; which font families Emacs recognizes, evaluate the following form:
;;
;;   (insert (mapconcat 'identity (font-family-list) "\n"))
;;
;; On v22 use:
;;
;;   (insert (mapconcat 'car (x-font-family-list) "\n"))

;; You can then ask fill-column-rule to use a specific font by setting the
;; variable `fcr-font' to the name of a font family (the value should be a
;; string). You might have to try various options before finding one that
;; displays well on screen.

;; If explicitly specifying the font family doesn't work, then it might be
;; that the fontset in use specifies an inappropriate font for thin space
;; characters, in which case the fontset specification needs to be modified
;; directly.  Get a list of possible font choices (distinct from font
;; *families*) by evaluating the form:
;;
;;   (insert (mapconcat 'identity (x-list-fonts "-*-iso10646-1") "\n"))
;;
;; When there are multiple options for a font, choose the one that is
;; "medium-normal-normal" or "medium-r-normal".

;; Now tell the fontset to use that font for a thin space:
;;
;;   (set-fontset-font "fontset-foo" #x200A
;;      "-apple-DejaVu_Sans-medium-normal-normal--0-0-0-0-m-0-iso10646-1")
;;
;; On v22, use 342378 instead of #x200A. (If you don't know which fontset to
;; modify, use M-x list-fontsets to see the possibilities.)

;; Known Issues
;; ===== ======

;; o The rule extends only to end of the buffer contents (as opposed
;;   to running the full length of the editing window).

;; o If the buffer contents do not end in a newline, then the rule
;;   extends only to the penultimate line.

;; There's no known way to fix the preceding, given Emacs present method of
;; internally representing buffer contents.

;; Todo
;; ====

;; o Play well with outline minor mode and other forms of folding
;;   (nxhtml mode, etc.).

;; o Perfrom better when Emacs is run as daemon.

;;; Mode Definition

;; Overview of how it works: The core mechanism sets the buffer's local
;; display table to display the newline character as a sequence of three
;; glyphs--a space, the character that represents the rule, and the newline
;; itself.  Each newline that falls short of the fill-column then receives an
;; overlay with a space-factor display specification that stretches the space
;; character by the amount necessary to make the rule appear at the fill
;; column.  On lines that overshoot the fill-column, we don't want the rule
;; to appear at all, so we put an overlay with a replacing display
;; specification that makes a meaningless character from the Private Use Area
;; of the Unicode BMP appear instead of the newline; the local display table
;; is set so that this character displays as a newline, without the
;; space or rule glyphs.  (We also need a workaround for a display bug.  See
;; the last section of this file for an explanation.)

;;; Hack for Display Bug

;; A apparent bug in Emacs's rendering (at least on the NS--i.e.,
;; MacOs--port) leads the modification of the display table spec for the
;; newline character to cause display artifacts to appear when horizontal
;; scrolling is in effect.  To avoid this, we use the following hack.  When a
;; window is horizontally scrolled, secondary overlays are placed over the
;; space-rule-newline trio on lines that appear within the window.  These
;; overlays have a display spec that replaces the newline glyph trio with a
;; string of the same visual appearance, designed to avoid triggering the
;; rendering bug.  When horizontally scrolling returns to normal we delete
;; any secondaries in the vicinity of the window contents (having many
;; overlays of this type in a buffer can slow vertical navigation); remaining
;; secondaries are deleted during the next idle period.
